```
 ~/graspit/build/graspit_simulator
```
### Graspit Support Packages
In this section, the procedure to build the packages graspit_commander and graspit_interface will be explained. Here it is assumed that a catkin workspace has been completely setup. The mentioned repositories should be cloned in the catkin_ws/src folder.

```
# Clone these repositories inside the src folder
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/graspit-simulator/graspit_interface.git
git clone https://github.com/graspit-simulator/graspit_commander.git

# Build Workspace after cloning the packages
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make

# After successful build of the packages
source devel/setup.bash
```
The graspit_interface package allows working with graspit simulator from ROS (Robotic Operating System), though only C++ language is supported. Incase of python support, the package graspit_commanander allows control over graspit simulator using python.

### The ROS command to launch the graspit_interface

<!-- Commands to run the interface -->
```
roslaunch graspt_interface graspit_interface.launch
```

Upon successful installation of Graspit, move onto the Scripts.md file to know how to use graspit interface through scripting.
